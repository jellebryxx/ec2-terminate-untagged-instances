# File: filter-instances.py 
# Description: This is an example script that you can author or modify that retrieves 
#              a list of instances from the Relay Interface (in the form of parameters)
#              and filters the instances that are untagged. It then sets the output
#              variable `instanceIDs` to the list of instances that are untagged. 
# Inputs:
#   - instances - List of instances to evaluate 
# Outputs:
#   - instanceIDs - list of instance IDs to stop in the next step
